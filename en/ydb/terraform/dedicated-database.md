# Creating and editing parameters of a dedicated database

To create a dedicated database, add the following code section to the project configuration file after the [provider initialization](./configure.md) section:

```tf
resource "yandex_ydb_database_dedicated" "my_database_2" {
  name = "dedicated-base"
  folder_id = "<folder ID in {{ yandex-cloud }}>"

  resource_preset_id = "medium"
  scale_policy {
    fixed_scale {
      size = 2 # Number of VMs in the database
    }
  }

  storage_config {
    group_count = 1
    storage_type_id = "ssd"
  }

  location_id = "ru-central1"
  network_id  = "enpv06v9b6ogg372hc71" # ID of the network where to create the database
  subnet_ids = [
    "e2lekh3vqf1pvao73lfv", "e9bmliplcipm13ek7uco", "b0cm0qpcf4q5vcfb2pc2"
  ]
}
```

Let's look at groups of settings for the dedicated database. First, set the two parameters: database name and its location in {{ yandex-cloud }}:
* `name`: Name of the database. It may contain lowercase Latin letters, digits, and hyphens. The first character is a letter, the last character is not a hyphen. It must be from 3 to 63 characters long. This is a required parameter.
* `folder_id`: ID of the directory (folder) in {{ yandex-cloud }} where the database will be created. This is a required parameter.

Next, you can define the number of virtual machines allocated to the database and their configuration:
* `resource_preset_id`: Name of the VM configuration template. You can use the following templates: `medium`, `medium-m64`, `medium-m96`, `large`, and `xlarge`. They differ in the processor platform, number of vCPUs, and amount of RAM. This [article](../concepts/resources.md#resource-presets) gives a detailed description of the VM template configurations.
* `scale_policy.fixed_scale.size`: This parameter sets the number of VM instances to be used by the database. The minimum recommended number of VM instances is two (for the production environment).

The configuration of data storage properties is described by the `storage_config` section, which sets up the following options:
* `group_count`: Number of [storage groups](https://ydb.tech/ru/docs/concepts/databases#storage-groups) which define the total storage size. One storage group is a multiple of 100 GB of disk space. You can only set integer values for storage groups.
* `storage_type_id`:  Storage type, either `ssd` or `hdd`.

The last set of properties for creating a dedicated database is the network section:
* `location_id`: Database location according to the availability zone set in the provider initialization section.
* `network_id`: Cloud network ID in the {{ yandex-cloud }} deployment.
* `subnet_ids`: List of IDs for subnets in which the database will operate. It contains all subnets belonging to the network in the {{ yandex-cloud }} deployment.

Once you have set up all the properties of the dedicated database, run `terraform validate` to make sure that the configuration file is error-free. Then run `terraform plan` to reconcile the changes contained in the configuration file with the current infrastructure configuration. Finally, run `terraform apply` to deploy the created resource in the cloud.

The time needed to create a dedicated database depends on the number of allocated VM instances and storage groups. To delete a dedicated database, remove the `"yandex_ydb_database_dedicated"` resource from the configuration file and run this command sequence: `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`.
