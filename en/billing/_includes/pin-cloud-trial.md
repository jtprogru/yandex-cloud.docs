Each cloud in {{ yandex-cloud }} must be linked to only a single billing account. If you relink an existing cloud, you are effectively transferring it between billing accounts. You cannot relink a cloud from a paid account to a trial period account. Likewise, you cannot relink the [DataSphere](../../datasphere/), [Tracker](../../tracker/), and [DataLens](../../datalens/) services from a paid account to a trial period account.
