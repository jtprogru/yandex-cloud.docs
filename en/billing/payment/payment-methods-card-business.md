## Linking a bank card {#pin-card}

When [creating](../quickstart/index.md) a billing account, you need to link a bank card.

{% include [payment-card-validation](../_includes/payment-card-validation.md) %}

{% note info %}

If you want to use only the **Transfer from your bank account** payment method, follow the instructions on [how to change your payment method](../operations/change-payment-method.md).

{% endnote %}


You cannot unlink a bank card from your billing account. Instead, you can [change the linked bank card](../operations/pin-card.md) in the billing account settings.
