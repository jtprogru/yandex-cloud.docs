# Report

A report is a primary accounting document that confirms services rendered. It contains aggregate data on the cost of the services actually rendered. Detailed information about the services rendered is available on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.

For residents of Russia, Yandex.Cloud LLC generates unilateral reports. Civil laws, the Tax Code, or laws on accounting do not require acceptance reports for fee-based service agreements. Work acceptance can be formalized as a report or another acknowledgment document (as per articles 783 and 720 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). Moreover, there are no legal regulations that require making a bilateral report or executing another bilateral document when delivering and accepting works or services.
Issuing of unilateral reports by Yandex.Cloud LLC is stipulated in an [offer agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/) signed with a customer. Provided reports contain all the details required under civil laws and laws on accounting, which meet all the requirements for primary accounting documents.

## Generating reports {#create-act}

Reports are generated at the end of the reporting period for the amount actually spent from the [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) balance.

Reports are then used as a basis for generating [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md).
