# Read your payment invoice

At the beginning of the next reporting period, businesses and individual entrepreneurs receive an [invoice](../concepts/bill.md) for the resources consumed over the previous month. The invoice is sent to the email address specified in the billing account. To learn how to top up your account and export its details, see [Top up your personal account](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md).
