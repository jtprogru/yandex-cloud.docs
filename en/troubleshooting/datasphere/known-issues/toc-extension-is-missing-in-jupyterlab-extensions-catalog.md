# You do not see the Table of Contents extension in the JupyterLab extension list

## Issue description {#issue-description}

You do not see the Table of Contents extension in the JupyterLab extension catalog in your DataSphere project running in the Serverless mode.
This extension facilitates navigation insideÂ the project files using headers.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

In the serverless DataSphere mode, JupyterLab 3.X isn't available yet.
You can use the [Dedicated mode](../../../datasphere/concepts/project.md#dedicated) where JupyterLab 3.5.3 is available.

Follow new DataSphere releases on the [changelog](../../../datasphere/release-notes.md) page in the documentation.
