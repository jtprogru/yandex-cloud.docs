# How to use grants and promo codes in Cloud billing

## Issue description {#case-description}

You need to apply a grant or promo code to your billing account in arrears.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

Grants and promo codes do not affect your account balance.
You cannot use [grants](../../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) and promo codes to top up your [account](../../../billing/concepts/personal-account.md) balance or clear the arrears on your account.

Before applying a grant or promo code, [top up your account](../../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md) to clear the arrears.

To learn more about the Yandex Cloud [grant](../../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) and [billing cycle](../../../billing/payment/index.md) for your account type, see the documentation.
