# Fixing the ERR.DS_API.SOURCE_CONFIG.TABLE_NOT_CONFIGURED error in DataLens

## Issue description {#issue-description}

When you load a table from Google Sheets or a CSV file, the data set preview shows the error:
```
        "code": "ERR.DS_API.SOURCE_CONFIG.TABLE_NOT_CONFIGURED",
        "message": "Table is not ready yet",
        "level": "error"
```

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

This error means that the dataset's schema has just been changed. Wait until the preview table is recreated (this may take several minutes).
