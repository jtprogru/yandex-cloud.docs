The `data-transfer.privateAdmin` role enables you to create, activate, and deactivate transfers that transmit data only on Yandex Cloud networks.

If you wish to prevent users from creating or activating transfers that transmit data over the internet, revoke the `data-transfer.admin` role and assign the `data-transfer.privateAdmin` role.

Currently, this role can only be assigned for working with a folder or a cloud.
