With the `datasphere.communities.viewer` role, you can view the list of communities and their settings, but can't create, delete, or edit resources. This role doesn't let you run an IDE.

The `datasphere.communities.viewer` role also includes all permissions of the `datasphere.community-projects.viewer` role.

In the DataSphere interface, users with the `datasphere.communities.viewer` role have the `Viewer` role in the Members tab on the community page.
