# Overview

{{ tracker-full-name }} is a collaboration tool that can help you facilitate and automate your HR workflows and set up effective collaboration between the HR team and other departments in your company.

Using [queues](queue-intro.md), you can systematize and group HR department issues by different activity areas and aspects. You will create separate queues for working with current and new employees and a queue for handling requests for recruiting candidates. You will configure forms for creating standard issues, automate replication of issues across queues, creation of sub-issues, updates of issue field values, and adding checklists.

Before you start:

1. If your organization does not work in {{ tracker-name }}, [connect the service](enable-tracker.md).
1. [Add users to {{ tracker-name }}](add-users.md).
