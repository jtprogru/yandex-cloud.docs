# Creating a queue for the support team


1. If your organization doesn't work in {{ tracker-name }}, [connect the service](enable-tracker.md).

1. [Add users to {{ tracker-name }}](add-users.md).


1. [Create a queue](manager/create-queue.md) using the <q>{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_queue-new-presets.preset-title--basic-support-preset }}</q> or the <q>{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_queue-new-presets.preset-title--tiered-support-preset }}</q> template.

   These [templates](manager/workflows.md) already include preset issue types and statuses that can be helpful for managing user requests. The <q>{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_queue-new-presets.preset-title--tiered-support-preset }}</q> template includes issue statuses like <q>Support line 1</q> and <q>Support line 2</q>.

1. Add your support staff to the [queue team](manager/queue-team.md).

1. You can also configure access [rights to issues within the queue](manager/queue-access.md) if needed. For example, you can restrict certain groups of users from creating or viewing issues in your queue.
