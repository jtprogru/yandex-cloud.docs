## Viewing the history of changes {#show-history}

Any changes to an issue are saved in the **History**. To view the history of issue changes:

1. Open the issue page.

1. To the right of the **Activity** section, click on the **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_b-ticket-workflow.comments }}** list (selected by default) and select **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_b-ticket-workflow.history }}**.

The change history saves:

* Names of the saved parameters.
* Parameter values before and after the change.
* Names of change authors.
* Date and time when the changes were made.

##  Sorting entries {#change-order}

Entries in the change historyÂ are ordered chronologically by default.

To change the order of entries, to the right of the **Activity** section, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/new-first.svg) **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_b-ticket-workflow.new-on-top }}**.

The issue comments will also get reordered.
