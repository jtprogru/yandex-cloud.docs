# VM Folder Watchdog

This application is based on [{{ sf-full-name }}](../functions). It starts and stops all {{ compute-full-name }} [VM instances](../compute/concepts/vm.md) in a folder on a preset schedule.

Use it to shut VMs down automatically when they are not needed to save on idle resources.

## Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of resources for the application includes:
* Fee for the number of function calls, computing resources allocated to executing the function, and outgoing traffic (see [{{ sf-full-name }} pricing](../functions/pricing.md)).
* Fee for standard queue requests (see [{{ message-queue-full-name }} pricing](../message-queue/pricing.md)).
