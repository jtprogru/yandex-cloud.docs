# Subscription

Subscriptions are prepaid pricing models. A subscription is valid for only one product instance. For a single product, you can create multiple subscriptions with different costs for different periods. There are two ways of creating a subscription: with and without integration with the [License Manager API](../license-manager/api-ref/index.md).

|   | **Without integration** | **With integration** |
|---|----------------|---------------|
| **Additional settings** | Not required | You need to set up integration with the License Manager API and revise the code of your application to check the status of subscriptions, their types, and implement their business logic |
| **Supported services** | {{ compute-name }} | {{ compute-name }}, support for other services is to be announced |
| **Pricing plan requirements** | `PAYG` + `Subscription` combined plan | `Subscription` only |
| **Subscription options** | Only for a specified period, e.g., a month, a year | In addition to periodic subscriptions, we offer custom subscriptions, e.g., a subscription for a number of users per month, etc |
| **Features** | <li>If the subscription expires, the user automatically switches to the `PAYG` plan</li><li>The user can switch from a subscription-based to the `PAYG` plan any time</li> | <li>If the subscription expires, the product stops working</li><li>The partner independently controls usage and sets restrictions for users in case of exceeding limits</li> |

The subscription starts from the moment of its purchase. If you change a subscription plan, the user will continue to use their active subscription, and will purchase a new subscription at the updated price.

{% note info %}

Subscriptions cannot be combined with the PAYG plan, where the user pays for the application metrics set by the publisher.
