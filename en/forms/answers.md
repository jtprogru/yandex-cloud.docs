   * If you select CSV or JSON, a folder with the saved file opens on Yandex Disk.
   * If new tabs are blocked from opening in your browser, a link to the saved file appears next to the **Save to Yandex Disk** button.
   * The attached files will be available in the `Yandex.Forms/<Form ID>/Files` folder on Yandex&#160;Disk and via the [link from the list of responses](#files).

   You can access the responses saved on Yandex Disk from any device and share them with other users. For more information about working with Yandex Disk, see [Help]({{ support-disk-main }}).

   {% endcut %}

## Get files that are attached to a form {#files}

Files that users attached to the form are available via links that you can find in the list of responses:

1. [Open the list of recent responses, download the responses in a file, or save them to Yandex&#160;Disk](#download).

1. In the list, find the response that has a link to a file and click it.

{% cut "If files are uploaded to Yandex Disk" %}

When you click the link, the file page opens on Yandex&#160;Disk. In this case, image and document preview is unavailable.

Yandex Disk stores files for an indefinite time. You can share them with other users.
- To download the file or share it click ![](../_assets/forms/drag-answer.png).
- To view a list of all files attached to the form, go to the folder by clicking ![](../_assets/forms/icon-back.png).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "If files are stored on the {{ forms-full-name }} server" %}

When you click the link, the file opens for viewing in your browser or downloads to your computer.


If you send a link to another user, they'll need to [log in to their Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}) to view the file.


{% endcut %}

{% note warning %}

Attached files are stored on the {{ forms-full-name }} server for 3 months. After this period expires, the files are deleted. We recommend [uploading files to Yandex&#160;Disk](#download) or saving them to your computer.

{% endnote %}

## View response statistics {#view}

To view brief response statistics:

1. Scroll down to the list of prompts.

You can see how many responses each prompt has. For multiple-choice prompts, you can see the vote distribution.


## Archive responses {#archive}

Responses to a form's prompts are automatically archived if you haven't viewed or downloaded them in more than three months. In [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md), form responses are not archived.

After archiving responses:

* You can [view the list of recent responses, download them in a file, or save them to Yandex&#160;Disk](#download). However, it takes several minutes to retrieve responses from the archive.

* [You can't view individual responses](#answer-in-detail) this way.
