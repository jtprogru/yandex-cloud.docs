* To set up automatic updates of start dates and deadlines for dependent issues, go to ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg)&nbsp;**{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_Gantt.timeline-config }}** and select **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_Gantt.shift-blocked-with-blocker }}**. If the deadline of the blocking issue is later than the start date of the dependent issue, this start date is shifted based on the blocking issue's new deadline.
