A critical path allows you to assess the risks of failing to meet a project's deadline. Issues with the farthest deadlines will have paths from the blocking issues specified in the project.

To have the critical path displayed, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-critical-path.svg) above the timeline on the right:

- A red line will appear on the timeline. It indicates an interval from the start date of the earliest issue to the deadline of the latest issue.

- The issue with the latest deadline will be highlighted in red. All issues blocking the project's final issues will also be highlighted in red.

To disable critical path display, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-critical-path.svg) once again.
