#### kms.viewer {#kms-viewer}

The `kms.viewer` role grants permission to view information about signature and encryption keys. It does not allow you to obtain a public key.

You can now assign this role to an [organization](../organization/), [cloud](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or [key](../kms/concepts/key).

This role can be granted by a {{ kms-short-name }} administrator (`kms.admin`).

For more information on using roles in {{ kms-name }}, read [{#T}](../kms/security/index.md).
