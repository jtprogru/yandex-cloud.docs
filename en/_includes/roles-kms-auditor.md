#### kms.auditor {#kms-auditor}

The `kms.auditor` role allows you to view a list of signature and encryption keys and get information about signature and encryption permissions. It does not allow you to obtain a public key.

You can now assign this role to an [organization](../organization/), [cloud](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or [key](../kms/concepts/key).

This role can be granted by a {{ kms-short-name }} administrator (`kms.admin`).
