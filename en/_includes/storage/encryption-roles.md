To be able to encrypt, a bucket user must have both the `storage.configurer` [role](../../storage/security/index.md#storage-configurer) and the `kms.keys.encrypter` role that allows key access. To decrypt objects, the user needs the `storage.configurer` and `kms.keys.decrypter` roles to read the encryption key.

For more information, see [{{ kms-name }} service roles](../../kms/security/index.md#service-roles).
