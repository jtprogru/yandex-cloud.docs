#### billing.accounts.member {#billing-accounts-member}

The `billing.accounts.member` role is granted automatically when a user is added to {{ billing-name }}. It is required to display the selected billing account in the list of all user accounts.

This role does not allow you to perform any actions with the billing account, but it can be used along with other roles.
