Every time you open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mysql.cluster.switch_explore }}** tab, you must enter the cluster user's username and password and select the database to connect to. This will open the database structure and the SQL query input window.

To avoid having to enter your password too frequently, open this management console page in a new browser tab.
