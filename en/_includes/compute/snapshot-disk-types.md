You can create snapshots of network [drives](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types), such as HDDs, SSDs, high-performance SSDs, and non-replicated SSDs. While taking a snapshot, high-performance and non-replicated SSDs are not available for writes. To take snapshots from local disks residing on [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), use [{{ backup-full-name }}](../../backup/). This service supports Ubuntu, CentOS, CentOS Stream, and Windows Server.
