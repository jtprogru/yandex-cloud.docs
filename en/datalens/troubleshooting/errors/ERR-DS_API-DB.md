# Error executing a query in the data source

`ERR.DS_API.DB`

This error occurs when the data source, such as a DB, returns an error while executing an SQL query. This is the data source error and not a {{ datalens-short-name }} error.

Some common and clear query execution errors (e.g., [ERR.DS_API.DB.ZERO_DIVISION](./ERR-DS_API-DB-ZERO_DIVISION.md)) are handled separately. Any unhandled errors refer to the `ERR.DS_API.DB` category.
