# Viewing all links to a page

You can view a list of all pages that refer to your page.

This feature helps you get your page ready for deletion: find and delete all links to it first.

1. Open the page.

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** and select ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/delete.svg) **{{ ui-key.beta-wiki.blocks_common_desktop.blocks_b-access-button.delete }}**.

1. Wait a few seconds for the data to load.

{% note warning %}

This method won't find links leading to [anchors](static-markup/links#section-link) on the page. 

{% endnote %}
