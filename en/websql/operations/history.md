# Query history

{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview-by-request.md) %}

In the query history, you can see all the requests executed within the connection session. You can view and repeat your previously executed requests:

1. Go to the **Query history** section (![image](../../_assets/websql/history.svg)). Successful queries are marked with ![image](../../_assets/websql/success.svg), failed queries are marked with ![image](../../_assets/websql/failed.svg).
1. Select a query: it will show up in the data panel.
1. Click **Execute** to repeat this query.

You can [edit the query parameters](query-executor.md) or [save your query as a template](templates.md).
