# Technical support pricing before October 1, 2023



{% note warning %}

Starting October 1, 2023, support service plans changed. See [Current service plans](../pricing.md) for details.

{% endnote %}

{% include [currency-choice](../../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

The cost depends on the selected service plan. For a table of all service plans and their features, see [{#T}](../overview.md).

The selected service plan applies to a billing account and [can only be changed](../overview#change-service-plan) by the billing account owner.

The basic service plan is provided to all {{ yandex-cloud }} users free of charge. For other service plans, the price is calculated based on the resources consumed for the current reporting period (calendar month). To calculate the cost of using the service, use our [calculator](/prices#calculator) or see the calculation methods in the sections below.

{% note info %}

* All prices are shown without VAT. The cost of technical support is calculated after deducting the amount of previously issued grants from the cost of the consumed resources.

{% endnote %}

### Basic {#base}

The basic service plan is provided to all {{ yandex-cloud }} users free of charge. It is suitable for personal and research projects.

### Standard {#standard}

Compared to the basic plan, the <q>Standard</q> plan lets you request general recommendations about the architecture of your solution from {{ yandex-cloud }} technical support. It is suitable for development and pilot projects.

#### Example of cost calculation {#standard-example}

You started paid consumption on March 1 and enabled support under the Standard plan. Every day a percentage of the fixed cost is debited from your account:

>$11.538462 / 31 = $0.372208

Where:

* $11.538462 is the fixed cost of technical support per month.
* 31 is the number of days in March.

If, by the end of the reporting period, you spend $769.230000 or less on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, no additional charges will apply. The cost of support will be $11.538462.

If, by the end of the reporting period, you spend more than $769.230000 on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, then, as soon as you exceed the $769.230000 threshold, a percentage of both fixed and additional costs will be debited from your account daily.

For example, you spent $769.230000 from March 1 to March 21, and then, from March 22 to the end of the month, you spent $8.000694 a day.

The total cost is:

>$11.538462 + (($769.230000 + 10 × $8.000694) − $769.230000) × 12% = $11.538462 + $80.000694 × 0.12 = $21.138545

Where:

* $11.538462 is the fixed cost of technical support per month.
* $769.230000 is the resource usage cost for the period from March 1 to March 21.
* 10 is the number of days from March 22 to the end of the month.
* $8.000694 is the resource usage cost per day from March 22 to the end of the month.


### Business {#business}

The <q>Business</q> plan is suitable for professional projects. Compared to the basic plan, it lets you:

* Request general recommendations about the architecture of your solution from {{ yandex-cloud }} technical support.
* Get advice and recommendations on configuring third-party software and fixing {{ yandex-cloud }} compatibility issues.
* Get recommendations for fixing problems with operating systems and their components.

#### Service plan cost {#business-price}




{% include [usd.md](../../_pricing/support/usd-business.md) %}


#### Example of cost calculation {#business-example}

You started paid consumption on March 1 and enabled support under the Business plan. Every day a percentage of the fixed cost is debited from your account:

>$76.923078 / 31 = $2.481390

Where:

* $76.923078 is the fixed cost of technical support per month.
* 31 is the number of days in March.

If, by the end of the reporting period, you spend $769.230000 or less on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, no additional charges will apply. The cost of support will be $76.923078.

If, by the end of the reporting period, you spend more than $769.230000, but less than $2,564.100000 on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, then, as soon as you exceed the $769.230000 threshold, a percentage of both fixed and additional costs will be debited from your account daily.

For example, you spent $769.230000 from March 1 to March 21, and then, from March 22 to the end of the month, you spent $20 a day.

The total cost is:

>$76.923078 + (($769.230000 + 10 × $20) − $769.230000) × 7% = $76.923078 + $100 × 0.07 = $83.923078

Where:

* $76.923078 is the fixed cost of technical support per month.
* $769.230000 is the resource usage cost for the period from March 1 to March 21.
* 10 is the number of days from March 22 to the end of the month.
* $20 is the resource usage cost per day from March 22 to the end of the month.

If, by the end of the reporting period, you spend more than $2,564.100000 on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, then, as soon as you exceed the $769.230000 threshold, a percentage of both fixed and additional costs will be debited from your account daily. Up to $2,564.100000, a percentage of additional cost is 7% of the amount you spent per day, and above that, it is 5%.

For example, you spent $769.230000 from March 1 to March 21. Then, from March 22 to March 26 , you spent $358.974000 a day and, from March 27 to the end of the month, $100 a day.

In this case, the additional cost of technical support before you exceed the $2,564.100000 threshold is calculated as follows:

>($2,564.100000 − $769.230000) × 7% = $1,794.870000 × 0.07 = $125.640000

Where $769.230000 is the resource usage cost for the period from March 1 to March 21.

The additional cost of technical support as soon as you exceed the $2,564.100000 threshold is calculated as follows:

>(($2,564.100000 + 5 × $100) — $2,564.100000) × 5% = $500 × 0.05 = $25

Where:

* $2,564.100000 is the resource usage cost for the period from March 1 to March 26.
* 5 is the number of days from March 27 to the end of the month.
* $100 is the resource usage cost per day from March 27 to the end of the month.

The total cost is:

>$76.923078 + $125.640000 + $25 = $227.563078

Where:

* $76.923078 is the fixed cost of technical support per month.
* $125.640000 is the additional cost of technical support before you exceed the $2,564.100000 threshold.
* $25 is the additional cost of technical support as soon as you exceed the $2,564.100000 threshold.
