# {{ speechsense-full-name }} pricing

At the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage, using {{ speechsense-name }} is free of charge.  However, {{ speechsense-name }} uses [{{ speechkit-full-name }}](../speechkit/index.yaml) to work properly. Audio file recognition is charged as per the [asynchronous recognition](../speechkit/pricing.md#rules-stt-long) pricing policy.
